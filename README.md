# Quantum-Computing
This repo includes basic exercises on quantum computing.

Exercises include: Basics (state representations, measures, unitary), single qubit gate operations(Pauli gates, Hadamard gate, Rphi gates - I,S,T,Tdg,Sdg, U gates), two-qubits gate operations (cx,cz,cy, cu1, swap), universal gates(expressing controlled gates in terms of H, Rphi, cx gates), implementing two qubit adder, and IBM Quantum Challenge Exercise-1 Tasks.

Requirements: qiskit(python package)
